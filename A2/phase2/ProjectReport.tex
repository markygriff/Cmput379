\section{Objective}
This assignment was an oppurtunity for myself to build experience
working with client-server development using named pipes (FIFOs) for
communication. It was also a valuable experience for learning
about the usefullness of file locking to restrict access to FIFOs.

\section{Design Overview}
\textbf{Program File:} a2chat.c \\
\textbf{Executable:} a2chat \\
\textbf{Function Returns:} 0 on success and -1 on failure. \\
\textbf{Makefile Options}: make $|$ make clean $|$ make tar \\

\noindent
\textbf{usage()}: Prints the proper syntax for calling the a1shell executable. \\

\noindent
\textbf{main()}: First, main() limits the CPU time of the program to avoid a hanging
process.
Next, the program either becomes a server or client program based
on the command line argument. \\

\noindent
\textit{Note: main() uses the return call to exit the program anytime BEFORE the processes
are created. This is purely a style choice and functions the same as \_exit()} \\

\noindent
\textbf{server}: ./a2chat -s fifo-name nclients \\
- Creates the fifos to be used for communication \\
- Reads from each in-fifo sequentially in a loop. \\
- Uses select() to check if there is data to read
in each in-fifo (timeout=1 us) \\
- Uses an array of custom client structs to keep track
of clients and their chat sessions. \\
- Assumes the first string of the client's 'open username'
message is the return fifo (out-fifo) for that client. \\

\noindent
\textbf{client}: ./a2chat -c fifo-name \\
- Assumes if there is a server error, the response
message will begin with "[server] error:"\\
- \\
- \\
- The client opens a chat session will always
belong to that chat session i.e. the client
who opened the session will recieve the messages
it sends to the other clients. \\

\noindent
\textit{Note: I chose to use a forked child process to poll
from stdin in both the server and client chat sessions. This
design choice was to keep code seperated and clean so to
prevent or isolate buggy behavior. As well, it allows the
user to exit either session seamlessly.}

\section{Project Status}
This project currently implements all functionalities outlined in the
assignment outline. \\

\noindent
Some difficulity in the implementation of this
assignment came from finding legitimate ways of testing the several
functionalites of the code. Fortunately, I found that testing gave me the
oppurtunity to learn and better my understanding of the various system calls
necessary for the completion of this assignment. \\

\noindent
Other difficulties included finding a means of tracking clients
and their chat sessions. I came up with the idea of storing client
info inside a struct to simplify this issue.


\section{Testing and Results}

A major part of my testing and debugging was done with
the help of the DEBUG\_PRINT macro I created for
debug printing. It can be enabled by defining DEBUG. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Singular Client Session Testing}: \\
Testing of a single client on a server was done
relatively simply, with debug printing. I came up
with unusual input command sequences to attempt to
break the program and asserted that the program
continued to function normally. \\

\noindent
Once I established that a single client session was
working properly, I moved on to testing multiple clients
on a single session. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Multi Client Session Testing}: \\
This is where testing became a little trickier.
I chose to use a terminal multiplexer (tmux) to help
run the a2chat program as multiple users on the same
server. The first tests done were basic functionality
tests such as sending messages, opening and closing
chat sessions, and extensively using the who and
to commands.\\

/noindent
Next, I wanted to cover some more obscure cases
that might not have been thought about during
development. Some examples of this included... \\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Opening maximum+1 number of users on server.
  \item  Adding a user to the chat session, closing that
    user, and sending a message to that user.
  \item Trying to open a chat session on a maxed out
    server, closing an open chat session, and trying
    to open the chat session again.
  \item Adding a user that does not exist to the chat
    session
\end{itemize}

\noindent
After I was satisfied with my results from testing
multiple clients on a session, I repeated my testing
for single client sessions to check that none of my
debugging of multi client sessions had broken the
program. \\

Project Status:
Currently, my a2rchat program has all of the functionality
specified in the assignment outline for phase 1 of assignment 2.

There is a small issue where the client cannot spawn a
chat session when using open. This happens RARELY and is caused
by a write error from the client to server. This write error
occurs when the server does not have the infifo open for read.
The server has a timeout of 0.25 seconds on each read so there
is a small delay (larger delay the more clients there are)
between each subsequent read of each infifo. For this reason, I
have chosen not to terminate on this specific write error and
to instead, give the server a second to read and respond. After
this change, I have not seen the issue reappear. However, I did
add a safety net so if the read error persists, the user is
told that there is an error with the server.


Client: ./a2rchat -c fifo-name

The clients have the ability to open a chat session. Any message sent to
the chat session is echoed back by the server of the chat session.


Server: ./a2rchat -s fifo-name nclients

The server can read from the in fifos and write to the accompanying out fifos.


Some things to note:
  - If there is no server present, the client cannot open a chat session.
  - The creation of the fifos is handled by the server
  - The deletion of fifos is handled by the 'make clean' command of the Makefile
  - The maximum buffer size is defined at the top of the file. Currently, it
    is set to 1024.
  - I am using the NONBLOCK flag for all opens. This is because the server must
    be reading through 'nclient' number of fifos and shouldn't be blocked on
    one.
  - The server has a timeout = 0.25 seconds on all of its reads.

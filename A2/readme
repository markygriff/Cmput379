Project Status:
Currently, my a2rchat program has the ability to spawn clients and servers,
as specified in the assignment outline.


Client: ./a2rchat -c fifo-name

The clients have the ability to open a chat session. Any message sent to
the chat session is echoed back by the server of the chat session.


Server: ./a2rchat -s fifo-name nclients

The server can read from the in fifos and write to the accompanying out fifos.


Some things to note:
  - If there is no server present, the client cannot open a chat session.
  - The creation of the fifos is handled by the server
  - The maximum buffer size is defined at the top of the file. Currently, it
   is set to 1024.
  - The deletion of fifos is handled by the 'make clean' command of the Makefile
